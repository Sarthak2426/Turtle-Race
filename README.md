# 🐢 Turtle Race

A tiny Python mini-game built with the standard **turtle graphics** module.  
Pick a color, place your bet, and cheer like it matters.

## ✨ Features
- Clean track with dashed finish line
- Six classic colors: `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`
- One simple race per run (no menus, no drama)
- Slower pace so you can actually see the turtles move
